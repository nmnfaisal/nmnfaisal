# Hi there 👋, I'm Noman

## Glad to see you here !✨
I am an Android Engineer 💻 with ~3+ years of experience. Being a Software Developer, it allows me to not only develop client-facing apps, but also develop them with state-of-the-art backend support. 🚁 I specialize in creating robust applications that meet all modern requirements. 🔥 I love designing applications that are lightweight and yet powerful, distributed yet synchronized, and beautiful yet efficient. 💙 I am focused on Java, Kotlin,  Coroutines, Databases, Jetpack Components, Flutter, Security, Servers, Optimization, as well as forward-looking technologies like SDK's Multi module Architecture, Flutter, KMM🌟

⚡ Fun fact: In my free time, I enjoy reading personal development books, writing about my thoughts, sharing my ideas, and talking about #WhatInspiresMe✨
